# Common report styles

Rageshakes can come from a number of applications, and we provide some practical notes on the generated format.

At present these should not be considered absolute nor a structure to follow; but an attempt to document the currently visible formats as of January 2022.

## Feedback 

Log files are not transmitted; the main feedback is entirely within the user message body.

This occurs from all platforms.

## Element Web / Element Desktop

Log files are transmitted in reverse order (0000 is the youngest) 

Log line format:
```
2022-01-17T14:57:20.806Z I Using WebAssembly Olm
< ---- TIMESTAMP ------> L <-- Message ----

L = log level, (W=Warn, I=Info, etc)
```

New log files are started each restart of the app, but some log files may not contain all data from the start of the session.

## Element iOS

Crash Log is special and is sent only once (and deleted on the device afterwards)

`crash.log`

Following logs are available, going back in time with ascending number.
console.log with no number is the current log file.
```
console.log (newest)
console-1.log 
...
console-49.log (oldest)

console-nse.log (newest)
console-nse-1.log 
...
console-nse-49.log (oldest)

console-share.log (newest)
console-share-1.log
console-share-49.log (oldest)
```

## Element Android

There is a historical issue with the naming of files, documented in [issue #40](https://github.com/matrix-org/rageshake/issues/40).

Log file 0000 is odd, it contains the logcat data if sent.

Log line format:
```
01-17 14:59:30.657 14303 14303 W Activity: Slow Operation: 
<-- TIMESTAMP ---> <-P-> <-T-> L <-- Message --

L = Log Level (W=Warn, I=Info etc)
P = Process ID
T = Thread ID
```
Remaining log files are transmitted according to their position in the round-robin logging to file - there will be (up to) 7 files written to in a continious loop; one of the seven will be the oldest, the rest will be in order.

Log line format:
```
2022-01-17T13:06:36*838GMT+00:00Z 12226 D/ /Tag: Migration: Importing legacy session
< ---- TIMESTAMP ---------------> <-P-> L        <-- Message ----

L = log level, (W=Warn, I=Info, etc)
P = Process ID
```

Once the fix to #40 is in place, we will see the following files:

```
logcatError.log
logcat.log
crash.log
keyrequests.log
log-[1-7].log
```

Log 1-7 are logs from a round-robin buffer and are ordered but the start point is undefined

## Third Room

Third Room uses `logs.json` file to submit logs.

`logs.json` file format:
```
{
  "formatVersion": 1,
  "appVersion": "0.0.0",
  "platform": "<UserAgent Info>",
  "items": [LogItem, LogItem, ...]
}
```

`LogItem` interface:
```typescript
interface LogItem {
  s: number; // start time
  d?: number; // duration time
  v: { // log item value
    [key: string]: any;
  };
  l: number; // log level
  e?: { // error
      stack?: string;
      name: string;
      message: string;
  };
  f?: boolean; // forced
  c?: LogItem[]; // children
}
```
